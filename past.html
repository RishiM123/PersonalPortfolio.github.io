      <td>I attended Sydney Technical High School, an academically selective school, and graduated in 2021. During my time there, I represented the school in 1st grade soccer, cricket, and basketball,
         and was the captain of the 1st grade basketball team. I also had success in regional cross country and athletics. I was part of the 1st grade soccer and cricket teams that won St George 
         championships, and I captained the Lidcombe churches soccer team that reached the Granville District Grand Final. For my HSC, I studied Extension 2 Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and 
         Advanced English. Overall, my high school experience was well-rounded and successful, with a focus on both academics and sports.</td>
      <td>I have gained work experience in various places, including Crinitis Italian Restaurant as a waiter, KFC in Sydney Central Plaza as a crew member, and National Australian Bank in security.
         Through these roles, I have developed strong customer service, communication, teamwork, attention to detail, and problem-solving skills that will be valuable in any future career pursuits.
